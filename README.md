## info
Government websites contain public information about Influential people, these dignitaries generally
present a higher risk for potential involvement in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position and
the influence that they may hold. The Influential people can be any minister or any politician and any
high ranking officer( mostly IAS, IPS or similar in other countries) in the government.
IntelleWings, wants to automatically build a global database of influential people and for that purpose
it wants to use publicly found information on government websites of every country of the world,
however, in this hackathon you need to address only 15 different countries. Manually scraping or
making individual parsers for each country website and extracting this information from thousands of
websites is going to be very tedious and inefficient. Our goal is to apply artificial
intelligence(NLP,deep learning) to extract information from these web pages with a single machine
learning program which can learn the different HTML structures of government and extract the profile
information OR apply any other superior approach to address this , but with a single program for all
government websites of the world.
The core part of this problem is that every government website of each country follows a different
HTML structure to display the list of government officials and ministers, so the program should be
intelligent enough to pick automatically the profiles with attributes from different structures of HTML,
it should NOT make individual parsers for each website.
Also, the languages used in different countries' govt. websites may be different, in such cases use the
english version of the govt. website( in the scope of this problem, the countries whose websites are
considered, have the english version available).
One additional important aspect- even within a country, the government pages may have different
HTML structures. Ensure you have a solution for the core part of the problem, which should be
evident in your designs/code and video.
